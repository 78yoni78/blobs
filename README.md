# Blobs
A graphical 2D simulation of living blobs that eat food and also each other

# What Is The Goal?
The goal was to create a simulation where through natural selection and high diversity interesting behaviors from real evolution will arise like camouflaging and fear of certain colors.

# Features
* Many randomly-selected properties for blobs such as speed, need for food, attack, field of view, and many more
* Visual representation for health of blobs
* Randomly spawning food and blobs
* Randomly selected names for each blob 
* Blobs can collide and kill each other
* Dead blobs turn into food
* Selecting and dragging blobs around the screen and pressing the space-bar spawns new blobs

## Implementation
* Collision detection is written by hand and uses a sweep-and-prune approch for faster performance and easy implementation
* Uses raylib for windows and graphics
* Flexible code for future additional features
